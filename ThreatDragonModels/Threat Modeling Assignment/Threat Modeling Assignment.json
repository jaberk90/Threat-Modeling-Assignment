    "description": "This system is a simple web application that provides a login page for users. It uses an open source authentication component to validate credentials against a database. If valid, the user is shown a message-of-the-day retrieved from the database, and they may submit comments that are also stored in the database. The model highlights the data flows between the client browser, the application, the authentication component, and the database, along with potential threats using the STRIDE framework.",
